Here’s a simple recipe to guide you through making fresh pasta dough, which can be used for various pasta shapes:\\n\\n### Ingredients\\n\\n- 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour or \\\"00\\\" flour (for a finer texture)\\n- 3 large eggs\\n- A pinch of salt\\n- Extra flour for dusting\\n\\n### Instructions\\n\\n1. **Make the Dough:**\\n   - On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, create a mound with the flour. Make a well in the center.\\n   - Crack the eggs into the well and add a pinch of salt.\\n   - Using a fork, beat the eggs gently and gradually incorporate the flour from the edges of the well until the mixture is too stiff to mix with a fork.\\n\\n2. **Knead the Dough:**\\n   - Gather the dough into a ball and begin kneading it with your hands. Knead for about 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, sprinkle a little more flour as needed.\\n   - Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. This helps relax the gluten.\\n\\n3. **Roll out the Dough:**\\n   - After resting, divide the dough into smaller pieces (about 4 portions). Keep the pieces you are not currently using covered to prevent them from drying out.\\n   - Flatten one piece slightly with your hand, then use a rolling pin or a pasta machine to roll it out to your desired thickness (usually around 1-2 mm for most pasta types).\\n\\n4. **Cut the Pasta:**\\n   - Once rolled out, you can cut the dough into your desired shape: \\n     - For **fettuccine**: Roll the sheet loosely and slice into strips.\\n     - For **lasagna**: Cut the sheets into rectangles.\\n     - For **tagliatelle**: Similar to fettuccine but usually wider.\\n     - For **ravioli**: Place filling on one sheet, cover with another, and cut into squares.\\n\\n5. **Cook the Pasta:**\\n   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fresh pasta and cook for 2-4 minutes, depending on the thickness. Fresh pasta cooks much quicker than dried pasta.\\n   - Taste a piece to check for doneness, and then drain.\\n\\n6. **Serve:**\\n   - Toss the pasta with your favorite sauce, whether it’s a simple olive oil and garlic, marinara, or a creamy sauce. Add freshly grated cheese, herbs, or vegetables as desired.\\n\\n### Tips:\\n- You can also add ingredients to the dough for different flavors, like spinach or beet puree for colored pasta.\\n- Make sure to keep the dough and cut pasta pieces dusted with flour to prevent sticking.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade Italian pasta!

Make a well in the center.\\n   - Crack the eggs into the well and add a pinch of salt.\\n   - Using a fork, beat the eggs gently and gradually incorporate the flour from the edges of the well until the mixture is too stiff to mix with a fork.\\n\\n2. **Knead the Dough:**\\n   - Gather the dough into a ball and begin kneading it with your hands. Knead for about 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, sprinkle a little more flour as needed.\\n   - Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature.

Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the flour.\\n  \\n2. **Add Eggs**: Crack the eggs into the well. Use a fork to beat the eggs gently, then gradually incorporate the flour from the edges of the well.\\n\\n3. **Form the Dough**: As the mixture comes together, use your hands to knead it into a dough. If the dough is too dry, add a little water, a teaspoon at a time. If it's too sticky, sprinkle with a bit more flour.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Knead the Dough\\n4. **Knead**: Knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. Form it into a ball.\\n\\n5. **Rest**: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a clean cloth. Let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.

Keep the pieces you’re not using covered to prevent them from drying out.\\n\\n7. **Roll**: Using a rolling pin or a pasta machine, roll out one piece of dough at a time into thin sheets (about 1/16 inch thick). Dust with flour as needed to prevent sticking.\\n\\n#### Step 4: Cut the Pasta\\n8. **Shape the Pasta**: Once rolled out, you can cut the pasta into your desired shape:\\n   - For tagliatelle: Roll the sheet up and slice it into strips.\\n   - For lasagna: Cut into rectangles.\\n   - For fettuccine: Cut into wider strips.\\n\\n#### Step 5: Cook the Pasta\\n9. **Boil**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
